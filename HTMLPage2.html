                        ATTENTION, RECRUITS!
                        This is not your grandmother’s knitting club! This is BLU, the Builders League United! A top-secret, highly classified, double-barreled organization dedicated to stomping out tyranny, communism, and those RED-loving scoundrels who think they can control gravel and land rights without a fight!

                        What does BLU do, you ask? We BUILD! We DEMOLISH! We STRATEGIZE! We wage corporate WARFARE in the name of progress and market domination. That’s right, BLU is your one-way ticket to glory in the underground world of construction, demolition, and... uh... mildly illegal sabotage!

                        We are the BLUE team. And while our suits may be corporate, our hearts are forged in battle! We fight with shovels, wrenches, mediguns, and an unyielding sense of DUTY!

                        Why Should You Join BLU?
                        Want to SMASH something legally? JOIN BLU.

                        Want a job where your coworkers are a pyromaniac, a spy, and a sentient pile of meat named Heavy? JOIN BLU.

                        Want to wake up every morning and not know whether you’ll be building a sentry gun or BLOWING UP a dam? JOIN BLU.

                        Here at BLU, we believe in grit, loyalty, and controlled explosions. If you're tired of boring office jobs and want to be part of something BIGGER, LOUDER, and more EXPLOSIVE—then strap in, maggot!

                        Join BLU today and help us do the impossible: beat RED at their own game.

                        BUILD. LEAD. UNLEASH. BLU!
